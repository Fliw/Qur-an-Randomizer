# How Can I Contribute?

Don't know how to start of open source and Contribute to our Open Source Project ? Welcome to the world of hacking!

The steps to follow to contribute to any projects:

1.  ## Install git
     
    If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

2.  ## Fork this repository

    Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
    This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

3.  ## Clone the repository

    Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

    Open a terminal and run the following git command:

    ```
    git clone "url you just copied"
    ```

4.  ### Add a upstream link to main branch in your cloned repo
    ```
    git remote add upstream <original repository>
    ```
5.  ### Keep your cloned repo upto date by pulling from upstream
    This will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes
    ```
    git pull upstream main
    ```
6.  ### Create your feature branch
    Always create new branch
    ```
    git checkout -b <feature-name>
    ```
7.  ### Track your changes
    ```
    git add .
    ```
8.  ### Check for your changes.
    ```
    git status
    ```
9.  ### Commit all the changes
    Write commit message as "Small Message"
    ```
    git commit -m "Write a meaningfull but small commit message"
    ```
10. ### Push the changes for review
    ```
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
11. ### Create a PR on Github.
        Just hit the create a pull request button, you must write a PR message to clarify why and what are you contributing

## üî• What will happen after my contribution?

I have created a simple page to display all contributors list [here](https://github.com/keshavgbpecdelhi/Web-Development/graphs/contributors), your name should appear shortly after the pull request is merged.

# ‚ùì What I have to do?

You have to make a demo webpage to show your frontend skills and update readme.md with the links of the folder you are uploading in the list (if already not available). Just make an issue beforehand that would be better.
